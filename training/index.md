## Open data science

Open data science tools, practices, and workflows underpin our work and all OHI assessments, as we describe in [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). 

[**Introduction to Open Data Science**](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/) is a hands-on training book that can be used to lead trainings or self-paced learning. Open data science means that methods, data, and code are available so that others can access, reuse, and build from it without much fuss. This training is not specific to OHI, but provides foundational skills for how to do reproducible research with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. 


## OHI Toolbox 

The OHI Toolbox is really open data science software used in a collaborative workflow to calculate OHI scores. It is built off the open data science tools and practices above.

[**OHI Toobox Training**](http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/) is a hands-on training book that can be used to lead trainings or self-paced learning. It will introduce you to the OHI Toolbox and how to use it to calculate OHI scores, and provide guidance as your team prepares to use the Toolbox. The training is accompanied by its predecesor, the OHI Manual.

The [**OHI Manual**](/manual) is a guide for the Conduct phase of the OHI process, which includes the Toolbox. It is not written as a hands-on training, but is the most comprehensive handbook of information to guide OHI assessments. The manual is not updated as frequently as the Toolbox Training.

## Eco-Data-Science trainings

These are additional tutorials our team has created that are useful for developing open data science skills and leading OHI assessments. Most are from [our eco-data-science study group](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) at the University of California Santa Barbara.

## OHI Global Fellows

The OHI Global Fellows Program is designed to fulfill our annual OHI assessment needs while providing opportunities for graduate students to learn cutting-edge data science skills and join the OHI Community of Practice. 

We piloted the program in 2018 with three UCSB graduate students. Check out their website [ohi-science.org/globalfellows](http://ohi-science.org/globalfellows/)!
